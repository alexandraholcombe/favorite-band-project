        <p>You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! Daylight and everything. For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!</p>

        <p>Tell her she looks thin. Guess again. Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? We're also Santa Claus!</p>

        <p>Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. Who are you, my warranty?! My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>
